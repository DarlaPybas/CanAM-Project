    <h3>June 2020</h3>
    <p>
        Sandra Hughes was an avid outdoors woman. She trained to be
        a park ranger and any chance she got she was outside. After
        college life became mundane for her, she became an accountant 
        instead of following her dreams.</p> 
        
     <p>At the time of her disappearance she had been living, working in 
        Maui, Hawaii. She decided to pick up her dream again and decided
        to treck to Yosemite and stay there for a couple weeks. Her family
        wished her luck and worried not about her as they knew the 
        experience she had. June 26th, 2020- that was the last day they saw 
        or heard from her. </p>

     <h3>July 2nd, 2020</h3>

     <p>Hughes camping gear, sleeping bag and other supplies are found strewn 
        all over by hikers near Johnson Meadow- where she said she would 
        be. But no sign of Sandra. Her niece advised something had to be
        wrong as Sandra was a very tidy person and would never just leave 
        her things in an array as they were. </p>   

    <h3>July 3rd, 2020</h3> 

     <p>A couple of hikers spot a barefooted woman with a bruise on her face.
        They offered assistance not knowing if she was okay, but she declined.
        They later found out it was Sandra Hughes. When searchers looked at
        the place of sighting she was again gone.</p>    

     <h3>July 5th, 2020</h3>

     <p>Hughes car, a silver Saab, was found appearing to have crashed into
        a tree then rolled into the rave at Chiquito Creek, which was just
        north of her campsite. Searchers combed the area. Nothing </p>

    <h3>July 12th, 2020</h3>

    <p>Her sleeping bag is found just outside of Yosemite National Park, 
        North of where her car was spotted. At this time, the searchers were
        reduced to a small number as they dod not expect to find anything. 
        They were right.</p>

    <h3>August 9th, 2020</h3>

    <p>Two hunters are driving along road 5S01 near Portuguege Creek. One of 
        them spots a woman leaning against a tree wearing a floral shirt and 
        overalls, drinking water. She was not distressed and avoided contact 
        with the men. This is the last known sighting of Sandra Hughes.</p>
