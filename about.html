        The CanAm Missing Project started when David Paulides was doing research in a National 
        Park and an off-duty park ranger expressed his concerns about the number of people 
        that had gone missing in the parks under strange circumstances.

        After Paulides started his research for that park, he felt he had uncovered mysterious 
        series of mass disappearances all over the world. These people, including the three listed 
        on the home page, all disappeared under very strange circumstances. Most were avid and
        experienced outdoorsman and women who were there one second, gone the next. Some were never
        seen again, not even their belongings. Some had their remains found and some were even found
        alive but didn't remember why they were out there and even what had happened to them while they
        were gone.
