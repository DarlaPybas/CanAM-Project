    <h3>November 15, 2015</h3>
    <p>Thomas Messick and six friends entered the woods near Horicon on 
        November 15th. All were equppied with their guns, bows, walkie 
        talkies and packs full of food and water. Not only was Messick an
        Army veteran but he also was an experienced outdoorsman, so much so
        that he once served as a hunter safety instructor. They all decided 
        to split off and part of them men went to the top of the hill (to push
        wildlife down the hill) and the others stayed at the bottom ready to 
        shoot. All hunters were maybe 100 ft apart from one another. This was
        the first time they have done any hunting in this area, but most 
        deifinitely not their first time hunting. It was described as a good
        day to hunt.</p>
    <h3>2:00pm</h3>
    <p>By this time everyone was supposed to meet back up, and everyone did
        except Thomas Messick. They waited an hour for him and at 3pm, they began
        to search. They drove through the woods beeping theirs horns and yelling for 
        Thomas, exactly where he had been only hours ago. 
    </p>
    <h3>4:30pm-Next Day</h3>
    <p>The group of hunters has now realized they need help. They call and 
        alert forest rangers who then searched all night for Messick. The other hunters 
        tried to reach out via the walkie-talkie, but nothing came back. They shot 
        their guns and flairs, but to no avail. There were over 180 people looking for 
        him. They searched 1.5 miles in every direction of Messicks last known location.
    </p>
    <h3>7 Years Later</h3>
    <p>The search went on for months, finally with no sign they called it off. There has 
        been no sighting of any of his belongings or him.
