    <h3>September 3rd 2014</h3>
    <p>38 year old Elk Hunter Aaron Joseph Hedges went on a hunting trip with
        two friends, Greg Leitner and Joe Depew. Taking along two horses, a mule
        their guns, bows and packs they started their way down Cottonwood Lake 
        Trailhead, toward Campfire Lake. Along the way, the mule gets spooked by
        something and throws all of Aaron's things off of it's back. They were able
        to gather everything except his sleeping bag. He had roughed it before however
        so this was no big deal to Aaron.</p>
    <h3>September 5th, 2014</h3>
    <p>After one night of no sleeping bag Aaron decided to go up to one of their
        cache spots nearby where they kept extra camping gear- including a sleeping
        bag. So he headed off to Sunset Lake with his walkie-talkie, cellphone, firearm
        and bow. Nobody worried about him as he was an experienced outdoorsman, having 
        grown up there. This, however, would be the last time he was ever seen alive again.</p>
    <p>The two friends waited all day and even the whole next day before even beginning to 
        worry about him. Luckily, when they did start to worry they just grabbed out their
        walkie talkie that had a GPS and saw where he was. He had missed his turn at a fork
        in the road, they just guessed he would notice that he had taken a wrong turn and come
        back since Aaron knew the place so well.</p>
    <h3>September 8th, 2014</h3>
    <p>They finally report Aaron missing as nothing has turned up. Immediately a search was
        mounted and even though the snow had slowed them down they still scoured the area 
        with helicopters with infrared systems, dog teams and horses but no sign of Aaron.
    </p>
    <h3>September 10th, 2014</h3>
    <p>
        With not a lot of hope left with the snowy conditions, they finally find a small sign.
        But, it did not make matters better. By a creek east of Sunlight Lake, there were 
        remnants of where someone had tried to start a fire using a pack of cigarettes, Aaron's 
        water bladder, waist strips off his backpack and his boots neatly and intentionally 
        placed side by side. All of these findings were very unusual for searchers especially 
        the straps from his backpack. What was even more puzzling was the fact that searchers
        had just went down that path the day before and the belongings were not there.  
    </p>
    <h3>June 15, 2015</h3>
    <p>After months of searching and no other signs of Aaron, the search was called off.
        Until a hiker named Roger Beslanowitch was walking near a relatives ranch and 
        came across a backpack with all of Aaron's belongins including: his cellphone,
        an orange hunting vest, bow, clothes, hunting license and granola bar wrappers. 
        Just ahead of him, he also spotted a thermos cup and an open energy drink nearby.
        After this report the cold case was reopened and the search began again, but to no avail.
    </p>
    <h3>August 6th, 2016</h3>
    <p>Finally after all the time of searching, Aaron Hedges' remains would be found. 
        They would be found a half a mile from where his gear had been found by Roger. 
        Not only was he 15 miles away from where he orginially went missing, but he was also
        six miles away from where his boots were. Meaning, he trecked in dense thickets with 
        blankets of snow on the ground barefooted. What has also perplexed many is that where his 
        gear was found, including his thermos, you could see the ranch nearby and a frequently 
        used road. Which means he saw his safety and never went to it. Why?
